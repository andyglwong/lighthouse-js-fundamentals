// Another common structure for looping in JavaScript is the for loop. The idea of a for loop is very similar to a while, only all the code that relates to the state of the loop is written on one line. Create a new file called chorus-for.js and add to it the following code.

// This new chorus program produced the same result as our previous. But as you can see, our counter variable, repeat, our condition that should be true for our loop to continue, and the incrementing of our counter variable, are all written in one line.

// Be careful with the syntax â€“ a for loop requires three statements separated by semicolons. The first is for initializing the loop, most commonly to declare our counter variable, the second for defining our while condition, and the last for updating the state of our loop after every step.
